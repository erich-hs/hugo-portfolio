## Projects
#### TabularCompare
Open Source tabular data comparison tool. Command Line Interface and Python library for enhanced reporting capabilities on tabular data updates.
* [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/erich-hs/tabularcompare)
* [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/tabularcompare/)

#### Air We Breathe
Study in progress with faculty members of Langara College. Implementation of nonstationary univariate time series imputation with an XGBoost meta-learner and LSTM layers for low and high-volatile air quality monitoring data.
* [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/erich-hs/Air-We-Breathe)

#### Elderly Wellbeing
To identify the concerns of communities in Canada about well-being among the elderly, social media data was scraped using the Twitter API v2.0 Academic Access and investigated through NLP methods. A Tableau Dashboard rendered our team a winning prize at Langara’s Applied Research Day fair.
* [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/erich-hs/Elderly-Wellbeing)
* [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/erich6116/viz/Elderly_Well-being_online/Elderly_Well-being)

#### Time Series Stationarity Test Microservice
Containerized microservice for Time Series Stationarity testing with Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) and Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) tests. Template repository with best CI/CD practices for cloud or local deployment.
* [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/erich-hs/ts-stationarity-micro)

#### [Google Landmark Recognition Challenge 2020]({{< ref "/posts/landmark_image.md" >}})
Competition sponsored by Google and hosted on Kaggle, the goal was to build a model that recognizes landmarks in photos. The project is my implementation of a metric learning solution with cosine similarity search (using an EfficientNet backbone for image embedding), paired with a DELF module for reranking based on local features of the images.
* [Article]({{< ref "/posts/landmark_image.md" >}})
* [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/erich-hs/Google-GLDv2-2020)

#### [Semi-Supervised Learning on Disasters Tweets]({{< ref "/posts/efficient_labeling.md" >}})
To improve data annotation efficiency on text data, the project proposes the method “Representative Labeling”. Results show that with a K-Means clustering, our baseline classification algorithms achieved similar metric scores with up to twenty times less labeled data.
